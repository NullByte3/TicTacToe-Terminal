# TicTacToe-Terminal
This is a simple tic tac toe made in nodejs can be used in Terminal no need for extra stuff and not only that, it's impossible to beat as it uses alpha/beta addon on top of the Minimax algorithm, so get rekt and of course, It's MIT license, so enjoy the code but I won't fix your bugs.
